# Prediction of Heart Disease at an Early Phase using Machine Learning

Instruments available to predict heart disease of patients are expensive. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and future problems. Various machine leraning algorithms can analyze the data of patients for some pattern to predict the future occurence of heart disease and can be used for health diagnosis.  
The project aims to predict possibility of occurence of hear disease by analyzing data of patients. Comparative analysis of classifiers like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest have been performed.
